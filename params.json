{"name":"BMO #1","tagline":"Esmond's first coding project","body":"### Welcome to Esmond's first summer coding project.\r\n\r\nThis was the first coding project for Esmond, fresh out of 1st grade. We worked on it over 3 days, 1-2 hours each day.\r\n\r\nThis was the first Android project for both of us... though we sidestepped the platform development toolchain by going with the Processing language and the APDE coding enviroment. \r\n\r\nProcessing allowed for us to focus on layout, shapes creation, and adding fills-- avoiding a lot of legacy syntax and library boilerplate typical with development. \r\n\r\nGoing with Android and APDE allowed us to code, compile and run the app on the same device. Staying on a touchscreen device for all aspects of the project seemed important to ease acceptance, and insure lasting relevance. Hopefully, this will lead to apps that have increasing personal utility for him.\r\n\r\nNeither of us had used Android before, but that wasn't a huge barrier. \r\n\r\n## Process\r\n\r\nWe started by sketching the layout on grid paper. Most of the work was in translating the grid scale of that paper to the display resolution. \r\n\r\nDrawing shapes in Processing is simple. We started by working with rect(), ellipse(), triangle(), and fill(). \r\n\r\nrect() allowed us to work with shapes that define width and height from the top left corner, and ellipse() allowed us to work with shapes with a center origin. triangle() will be a good segue into more complex shapes using quad(), and vetrex().\r\n\r\nfill() was a good introduction to the procedural side of Processing, and will also be good to reference when working with vertex() and the draw() loop.\r\n\r\n## Tools \r\n\r\nWe took our inspiration from a BMO plush-- though there were a lot of shape and color adjustments made per Esmond's discretion. He quickly became pretty comfortable increasing and decreasing the Red, Green and Blue values (0-255) to \"mix\" the right color.\r\n\r\nWe used ColorPicker by Achim Heynen (for iPhone) to select the colors from the plush, in real life. \r\n\r\nWe used APDE - Android Processing IDE by CalsignLabs for the IDE.\r\n\r\nEsmond did all the coding-- I just did the final app build, the icon (from a screenshot), and the readme.md writeup. \r\n\r\n## Next\r\n\r\nI think our future projects will stick with this setup, and include more complex shapes using vertex(), and some interactivity.\r\n\r\nIf you have an Android device, [here's a link to the built app.](https://github.com/nesmod/BMO1/blob/master/bin/bmo1.apk). It's only been tested on a Samsung Galaxy Tab, so your milage may vary.\r\n\r\n[https://github.com/nesmod/BMO1/blob/master/sketch.pde](Here's the code he wrote.) I wrote the comments, but every one of those parameters for shape position, size and fill are his. When the position, shape or color wasn't right, he made changes, and built the app again.\r\n\r\nThanks for checking out the project!\r\n\r\nCorey (Esmond's Dad)\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n## Below are a few photos from the app creation. \r\n\r\n### Initial sketch on grid paper\r\n![grid sketch](http://coreyargentine.com/esmond/0-grid-sketch.jpg)\r\n\r\n### The setup \r\n![The setup](http://coreyargentine.com/esmond/1-the-setup.jpg)\r\n\r\n### The work in progress and inspiration \r\n![work in progress](http://coreyargentine.com/esmond/2-work-in-progress-with-inspiration.jpg)\r\n\r\n### Using the Color Picker app\r\n![color picker](http://coreyargentine.com/esmond/3-rgb-color-picker-app.jpg)\r\n\r\n### Screenshot of the final app icon\r\n![final app icon](http://coreyargentine.com/esmond/5-bmo1-on-android.png)\r\n\r\n### Screenshot of the final app\r\n![final app](http://coreyargentine.com/esmond/4-screenshot-of-final-app.png)\r\n\r\n","google":"UA-64592847-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
