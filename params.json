{"name":"BMO1","tagline":"Esmond's first coding project","body":"### Welcome to Esmond's first summer coding project.\r\n\r\nThis was the first coding project for Esmond, fresh out of 1st grade. We worked on it over 3 days, 1-2 hours each day.\r\n\r\nThis was the first Android coding project for both of us... though we sidestepped the platform development toolchain by going with Processing and APDE. \r\n\r\nGoing with Processing allowed for us to focus on layout, shapes creation, and adding fills-- avoiding a lot of legacy syntax and library boilerplate typical with development. \r\n\r\nGoing with Android and APDE allowed us to code, compile and run the app on the same device. Going with a touchscreen device seemed important to ease acceptance, and insure lasting relevance (and hopefully utility).\r\n\r\nNeither of us had used Android before, but that wasn't a huge barrier. \r\n\r\n## Process\r\n\r\nWe started by sketching the layout on grid paper. Most of the work was in translating the grid scale of that paper to the display resolution. \r\n\r\nDrawing shapes in processing is simple, so we just worked with rect(), ellipse(), triangle(), and fill(). \r\n\r\nrect() allowed us to work with shapes that define width and height from the top left corner, and ellipse allowed us to work with shapes with a center origin. There was only one triangle, but it will be a good segue point into quad(), and then vetrex().\r\n\r\nfill() was a good introduction to the procedural side of Processing, and will also be good to reference when working with vertex() and the draw() loop.\r\n\r\n## Tools \r\n\r\nWe took out inspiration from a BMO plush-- though there were a lot of adjustments made per Esmond's discretion. \r\n\r\nWe used ColorPicker by Achim Heynen (for iPhone) to select the colors from the plush. \r\n\r\nWe used APDE - Android Processing IDE by CalsignLabs for the IDE.\r\n\r\nEsmond did all the coding-- I just did the final app build, the icon (from a screenshot), and the readme.md writeup. \r\n\r\n## Next\r\n\r\nI think our future projects will stick with this setup, and include more complex shapes using vertex(), and some interactivity.\r\n\r\nCorey (Esmond's Dad)\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n## Below are a few photos from the app creation. \r\n\r\n### Initial sketch on grid paper\r\n![grid sketch](http://coreyargentine.com/esmond/0-grid-sketch.jpg)\r\n\r\n### The setup \r\n![The setup](http://coreyargentine.com/esmond/1-the-setup.jpg)\r\n\r\n### The work in progress and inspiration \r\n![work in progress](http://coreyargentine.com/esmond/2-work-in-progress-with-inspiration.jpg)\r\n\r\n### Using the Color Picker app\r\n![color picker](http://coreyargentine.com/esmond/3-rgb-color-picker-app.jpg)\r\n\r\n### Screenshot of the final app\r\n![final app](http://coreyargentine.com/esmond/4-screenshot-of-final-app.png)\r\n","google":"UA-64592847-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
